This respository contain many of useful MATLAB programming codes for nyquist plot of any transfer function ,bode plot of transfer function,
Pole-Zero Cancelletion technique of transfer function,steady state response of transfer function and nyquist sampling rate from digital
communication and control systems.
Hope you find this codes are useful.
